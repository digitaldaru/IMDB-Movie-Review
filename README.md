# IMDB Movie Reviews
## What is IMDB Dataset?
### This dataset contains movie reviews posted by people on the IMDb website, as well as the corresponding labels (“positive” or “negative”) indicating whether the reviewer liked the movie or not.
### This is a dataset for binary sentiment classification. This dataset provides a set of 25,000 highly polar movie reviews for training, and 25,000 for testing. The training and testing sets are balanced, meaning they contain an equal number of positive and negative reviews.
